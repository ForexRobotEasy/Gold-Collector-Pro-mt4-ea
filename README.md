## How it Works

### Global Variables

The expert advisor defines two global variables:
- `secretKey`: A string variable that holds a secret key for authentication purposes.
- `isFakeVersionDetected`: A boolean variable used to detect fake versions of Gold Collector Pro.

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the initialization function of the expert advisor. It performs the following tasks:
- Checks for fake versions of Gold Collector Pro using the `IsFakeVersion()` function.
- If a fake version is detected, it prints a warning message and sets `isFakeVersionDetected` to true. The initialization fails in this case.
- Other initialization tasks can be performed here.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is the deinitialization function of the expert advisor. It is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart. Any necessary deinitialization tasks can be performed in this function.

### Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the expert advisor that is executed on each tick of the market. It performs the following tasks:
- Checks if a fake version is detected. If so, it returns without proceeding further.
- Identifies and analyzes the trend using the `IdentifyTrend()` function.
- Opens buy or sell trades based on the trend direction using the `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions.
- Manages the grid strategy and adjusts positions using the `ManageGridStrategy()` function.
- Monitors and manages drawdown using the `ManageDrawdown()` function.
- Calculates and displays important statistics using the `CalculateAndDisplayStatistics()` function.

### Trend Identification

The `IdentifyTrend()` function is responsible for identifying and analyzing the trend of gold prices. It implements a specific logic to determine the trend direction. In this example, it assumes the trend is up and returns `TREND_UP`.

### Trade Execution

The `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions are used to open buy and sell trades, respectively. These functions implement the logic for executing trades based on the identified trend direction.

### Grid Strategy Management

The `ManageGridStrategy()` function is responsible for managing the grid strategy. It includes the logic for adjusting positions and optimizing trade entries and exits.

### Drawdown Management

The `ManageDrawdown()` function handles the management of drawdown. It includes mechanisms to monitor drawdown levels and take necessary actions to mitigate risks.

### Statistical Analysis

The `CalculateAndDisplayStatistics()` function calculates and displays important statistics related to the expert advisor's performance. This provides valuable insights into the profitability and effectiveness of the trading strategy.

### Fake Version Detection

The `IsFakeVersion()` function is used to check for fake versions of Gold Collector Pro. It implements a specific logic to detect fake versions. In this example, it assumes no fake version is detected and returns false.
